## About Me

**Hi! I'm Greer.** I am a first year master's student in the iSchool,
concentrating in archives.

Before moving to Madison, I worked as a paralegal after graduating college. I
majored in history in undergrad; my focus was the Cold War and my senior thesis
was on the postwar occupation of Japan.

### Interests

- Metadata - Archives accessibility - Visualizing historical data


#### Tools/Methods

- Mapping; I have used the Mapping Inequality project before and I think it is
fantastic: [Mapping
